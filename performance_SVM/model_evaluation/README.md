# False Positives / True Negatives Analysis

We focused on **false positives (FP)** and **true negatives (TN)**, as well as other comparative evaluations. The aim was to find differences that could explain this results. 

## Analysis Types

- **Helix Domain Presence**  
  Comparison of helix domain occurrence between FP and TN sequences.

- **Amino Acid Frequencies**  
  Frequency analysis of residues across **true positives (TP)** and **false negatives (FN)**.

- **Residue Distributions**  
  Distribution plots for individual residues to highlight differences between dataset subset, considering single ammino-acids distribution, global and grouped frequencies. 

- **Residue Chemical/Physical Properties**  
  Analysis of residues grouped by chemical/physical characteristics (hydrophobic, polar, charged, etc.).

- **Sequence Logos**  
  Logos representing conserved patterns in FP, TN, TP, and FN sequences.

- **Feature Boxplots**  
  Boxplots for single features identified as informative by the SVM mode, including the different scales used for feature selection.
