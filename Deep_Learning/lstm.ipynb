    " # 2. Network definition and infrastructure preparation\n",

    " ## 2.1. Neural Network Architecture: Hybrid CNN-LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement a hybrid Deep Learning architecture designed to capture both local structural motifs and global sequential patterns in protein sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture consists of three main blocks:\n",
    "2.1.1.  **Convolutional Block (CNN):** Uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 17 (approx. length of a Signal Peptide hydrophobic region) to extract local biochemical features (motifs) from the One-Hot encoded sequence.\n",
    "2.1.2.  **Recurrent Block (LSTM):** Processes the feature map generated by the CNN to model sequential dependencies and long-range interactions along the amino acid chain.\n",
    "2.1.3.  **Classification Head (MLP):** A dynamic Multi-Layer Perceptron that takes the final hidden state of the LSTM and outputs the probability of the sequence being a Signal Peptide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2. Infrastructure preparation for further utility\n",
    "This section implements also the essential infrastructure to train, validate, and test the model efficiently, addressing memory constraints and training stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1. Custom Dataset: `SignalDataset`\n",
    "To handle the large memory footprint of One-Hot encoded sequences, we implement a **Lazy Loading** strategy:\n",
    "* **Memory Efficiency:** The class stores only references to the raw NumPy arrays rather than creating tensor copies immediately.\n",
    "* **On-the-fly Conversion:** Data is converted into PyTorch Tensors only within the `__getitem__` method, exactly when the DataLoader requests a specific batch.\n",
    "* **Label Shaping:** It ensures target labels are reshaped to `[1]` to ensure compatibility with the `BCELoss` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2. Training Engine: `train_val`\n",
    "The main loop that orchestrates the learning process. It includes several stability mechanisms:\n",
    "* **Gradient Clipping:** We apply `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(max_norm=1.0)` to prevent the **Exploding Gradient** problem (common in LSTMs), ensuring stable weight updates.\n",
    "* **Early Stopping:** The training monitors the Validation MCC. If performance stops improving for a defined number of epochs (`patience`), training terminates early to prevent **Overfitting**.\n",
    "* **Best Model Tracking:** The function automatically saves and returns the weights of the *best* performing epoch, ensuring we don't return an overfitted model from the final epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3. Inference: `test`\n",
    "A lightweight function for evaluating the model on the Test or Benchmark sets:\n",
    "* **Evaluation Mode:** Sets `model.eval()` to disable stochastic layers like Dropout and freeze Batch Normalization stats.\n",
    "* **Resource Optimization:** Uses `torch.no_grad()` to skip gradient computation, reducing memory usage and speeding up inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.4. Hardware Acceleration\n",
    "The code automatically detects available hardware (`torch.cuda.is_available()`) to offload computations to the **GPU** for significantly faster training times."

    "# 3. Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we execute an automated **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)** pipeline to determine the optimal configuration for our hybrid **CNN-LSTM** architecture (`SignalPeptideLSTM`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the complexity of the model and the biological variability of the signal peptides, manually selecting parameters would be inefficient. We leverage **Ray Tune** to explore the search space systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "To ensure robust model selection and computational efficiency, the pipeline incorporates:\n",
    "1.  **5-Fold Cross-Validation:** Each configuration is trained and validated on 5 different splits of the data to avoid overfitting to a specific subset. The selection metric is the **Average MCC** across folds.\n",
    "2.  **Memory Optimization:** To prevent *Out-Of-Memory (OOM)* errors with the One-Hot encoded dataset, we utilize **Ray's Shared Object Store**. Data is loaded once into shared memory and accessed by reference, minimizing RAM usage.\n",
    "3.  **Resource Management:** We enforce sequential execution (1 trial at a time) to fully utilize the GPU without saturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Search Space\n",
    "We tune a combination of architectural and training parameters:\n",
    "* **Architecture (LSTM):** Number of stacked layers (`num_lstm_layers`) and hidden state dimension (`lstm_hidden_size`).\n",
    "* **Architecture (MLP Head):** Dynamic depth (`num_layers`) and width (`hidden_sizes`) of the classification head, testing both \"Funnel\" and \"Flexible\" topologies.\n",
    "* **Optimization:** Learning Rate (`lr`) and Batch Size (`batch_size`).\n",
    "* **Regularization:** Dropout probability (`dropout`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "The goal of this section is to identify the **Best Trial Configuration**. These optimal hyperparameters will be retrieved and used to instantiate the final model for the definitive performance evaluation on the independent benchmark dataset (see `benchmark_test.ipynb`)."
