# Sequence Length Comparison

A set of visual analyses are used for comparing sequence lengths and amino-acid frequency characteristics across different subsets of a protein dataset.  
The plots focus on signal peptide (SP) length distributions, amino-acid composition, and dataset-level comparisons.

## Plot Types

### 1. Violin Plots 
Seven violin plots showing the distribution of signal peptide lengths across:
- **Training set — positive class** and **Training set — negative class**
- **Benchmark set — positive class** and **Benchmark set — negative class**
- **Training vs benchmark (global comparison)**
- **Combined distribution across all samples**

These plots highlight variation and differences in SP length across datasets and label classes.

### 2. Amino-Acid Frequency Plots 
Five plots showing amino-acid frequencies grouped by **chemical/physical properties**, including:
- Hydrophobic
- Polar
- Charged
- Aromatic
- Special-case residues

These charts help characterize compositional differences across datasets.

### 3. Signal Peptide Length Comparison 
Four plots comparing SP lengths between:
- **Benchmark set**
- **Training set**
- **Train vs benchmark**
- **Overall summary comparison**

These plots provide a high-level overview of SP length variability between dataset partitions.
