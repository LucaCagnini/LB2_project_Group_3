# Protein Sequence Logos

This repository contains four sequence logo images generated from the datasets obtained from the previos step (data preparation). Sequence logos provide a visual representation of conserved positions within a multiple sequence alignment, highlighting residue frequencies and help identify functional or structural motifs.
The images include: 
- benchmark logo
-  a training-set logo
-   a mirrored version
-   one created with a specific custom palette

All other logos use a color scheme based on residue hydrophobicity.
