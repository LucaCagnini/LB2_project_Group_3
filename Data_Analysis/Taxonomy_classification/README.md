# Taxonomy Classification Plots

Taxonomy-classification visualizations were generated from our dataset.  
Two plot types are included: barplots and pie charts. Each plot type is provided in four variants to reflect different classification levels and dataset subsets.

## Plot Types

- **Barplots**
  - **Benchmark (kingdom):** shows the distribution of sequences across kingdoms in the benchmark set.  
  - **Benchmark (species):** visualizes species-level composition in the benchmark set.  
  - **Training set (kingdom):** displays kingdom-level distribution within the training set.  
  - **Training set (species):** presents species-level distribution for the training set.

- **Pie Charts**
  - **Benchmark (kingdom):** pie representation of kingdom proportions in the benchmark set.  
  - **Benchmark (species):** species-level composition shown as a pie chart for the benchmark set. 
  - **Training set (kingdom):** pie chart illustrating kingdom distribution in the training set.  
  - **Training set (species):** pie chart showing species representation in the training set.
