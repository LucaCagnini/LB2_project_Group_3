### **The VonHeijne method for SP detection** 
This repository contains the implementation of the **Von Heijne method** for signal peptide cleavage site prediction.
The method builds a **Position-Specific Weight Matrix (PSWM)** using experimentally validated protein sequences and compares them against background amino acid frequencies (SwissProt). Pseudocount +1 was used to avoid zero probabilities. 
For the method implementation, the following parameters were considered: 
- Aminoacids Window: [-13, +2] relative to the cleavage site
- Background distribution: SwissProt amino acid frequencies
- PSWM: built from positive examples (proteins with confirmed signal peptides)
- Goal: identify likely cleavage sites by comparing observed amino acid frequencies with the   background model

## **PSWM implementation** 

The script *create_pswm.ipynb* was produced to build a Position-Specific Weight Matrix (PSWM) from a training dataset of proteins with annotated signal peptides in the *train_bench.tsv* file. 
The input DataFrame used must contain sequences and a SPEnd index for the cleavage site.

## **Evaluation of the Von Heijne Method**

The script *validation_and_testing_vonheijne* provides code to evaluate the performance of the Von Heijne algorithm for signal peptide cleavage site prediction.
The evaluation is split into three main steps:

1. # **Scoring with the PSWM**
Each sequence is scanned with a sliding window (14–15 aa length). For each window, a score is computed by summing log-odds values from the Position-Specific Weight Matrix (PSWM).The highest-scoring window is retained as the candidate cleavage site.

2. # **Threshold optimization (Validation set)**

Precision–Recall curves are computed on the validation set. The best threshold is chosen by maximizing the F1-score.

3. # **Testing and metrics**
On the test set, predictions are evaluated using:
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
- Accuracy (ACC)
- Precision (PPV)
- Recall (SEN)
