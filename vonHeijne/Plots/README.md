## Plots
---
Each file contains two types of plots:


### Heatmaps 
A heatmaps representing residue-position scoring matrices derived from the von Heijne algorithm.  
Each heatmap highlights the positional contribution of amino acids to signal peptide detection across different cross-validation folds.


### Precision–Recall Curves 
PR curves corresponding to the same five-fold cross-validation splits.  
These curves illustrate model performance by showing precision and recall at varying score thresholds, enabling comparison across folds.
